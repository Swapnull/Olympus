# Self Driving Car
This is a self driving car project that I will be undertaking for my final year project. It will use a microprocessor (Arduino) and single-board computer (Parallella) to control a base that I will build.

### Software used
- *Arturo (https://github.com/scottdarch/Arturo)* - An extended version of amperka/ino, a build tool for arduino projects in the command line.
