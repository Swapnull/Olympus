Acknowledgments
---
I would like to thank my project supervisor Dr Pete Collingwood for the belief he showed in me with this project and for putting me straight all the times I was wrong and too stubborn to see it.
I would also like to thank Dr Mike Meredith and Dr Chris Bates for their help during my degree.
Finally, I would like to thank my dad for pushing me to my best and teaching me that second place is not good enough.
